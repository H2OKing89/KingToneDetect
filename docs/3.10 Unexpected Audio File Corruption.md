# **3.10 Unexpected Audio File Corruption**

- **Problem**: Files could get corrupted during recording or conversion, leading to loss of critical audio data.
- **Solution**: To mitigate this, file integrity checks are implemented after recording and conversion processes to ensure data accuracy and prevent corrupted files from being used or lost.

#### **Recording Configuration Setup:**

```ini
; ==================
; RECORDING CONFIGURATION
; ==================
[Recording]
record_delay = 3.5  ; Delay before recording starts after tone detection (seconds)
mini_record_time = 30  ; Minimum recording time (seconds)
max_record_time = 40  ; Maximum recording time (seconds)
adaptive_silence_threshold = true  ; Automatically adjust silence threshold based on background noise
initial_silence_threshold = -40  ; Starting threshold for silence detection (dB)
min_silence_threshold = -60  ; Minimum silence threshold allowed (dB)
silence_detection_grace_period = 5.0  ; Time before silence detection starts (seconds)
silence_duration_threshold = 10.0  ; Maximum silence before stopping recording (seconds)
convert_to_mp3 = true  ; Convert WAV to MP3 after recording
mp3_bitrate = 64000  ; Bitrate for MP3 conversion (bps)
wav_file_path = /audio/wav/  ; Directory for WAV files
mp3_file_path = /audio/mp3/  ; Directory for MP3 files
audio_codec_path = /codec/  ; Directory for audio codec used during conversion
disk_space_limit_mb = 500  ; Stop recording if disk space falls below this threshold (in MB)
max_parallel_recordings = 5  ; Maximum number of parallel recordings allowed
recording_isolation = true  ; Enable isolation for parallel recordings
recording_priority = equal  ; Priority handling for simultaneous recordings
disk_space_error_threshold_mb = 100  ; Trigger an alert if available space drops below this
on_disk_space_error = stop_recording  ; Action to take when disk space is critically low
```

#### **File Integrity Checks Configuration:**

```ini
; ==================
; FILE INTEGRITY CHECKS
; ==================
[File_Integrity_Checks]
enable_file_integrity_checks = true  ; Enable integrity checks after recording and conversion
integrity_check_algorithm = md5  ; Algorithm used for integrity checks (e.g., md5, sha256)
max_retry_attempts = 3  ; Maximum retry attempts for corrupted file recovery
retry_delay = 30  ; Delay between retry attempts (in seconds)
log_corrupted_files = true  ; Log details of corrupted files for future analysis
notify_admin_on_failure = true  ; Notify admin if a file remains corrupted after retries

; ==================
; CORRUPTION HANDLING
; ==================
[Corruption_Handling]
corruption_action = retry  ; Action to take when a file is corrupted (options: retry, delete, notify)
failed_conversion_backup_path = /audio/failed_conversion/  ; Path to store corrupted files for later review
on_corruption_retry_attempts = 3  ; Number of retry attempts before giving up on the file
fallback_to_wav = true  ; If MP3 conversion fails, keep the original WAV file as a fallback
```

#### **Key Aspects of the Configuration**:

1. **Recording Time Settings**: 
   - Configurations ensure the program will not prematurely stop or allow runaway recordings. Adaptive silence detection keeps background noise from interfering with recording quality.

2. **Parallel Recording Support**: 
   - Up to five parallel recordings are supported, with isolation and priority handling to ensure multiple departments can be recorded simultaneously without interference.

3. **Disk Space Monitoring**: 
   - Disk space monitoring ensures that the system does not continue recording if the available space falls below the defined limit, helping prevent issues from low storage.

4. **File Integrity Checks**:
   - After each recording or conversion process, an integrity check (using MD5 by default) is run to ensure that the files are not corrupted. This prevents the system from distributing incomplete or corrupted audio files.

5. **Corruption Handling**:
   - If a file is found to be corrupted, the system will attempt up to 3 retries. If the corruption persists, the file will be logged, and the administrator will be notified. Corrupted files can also be backed up for further analysis in a dedicated directory.
   - If an MP3 conversion fails, the original WAV file will be used as a fallback to avoid data loss.

#### **Potential Enhancements**:

1. **Graceful Stop During Low Disk Space**:
   - If disk space falls below a critical threshold, the system can complete current recordings before stopping new ones, minimizing disruption.

2. **Checksum Validation**:
   - Use different integrity check algorithms (e.g., SHA-256) based on performance or security needs to ensure stronger file validation.

3. **Automated Recovery**:
   - Implement an automated recovery mechanism for corrupted files that can automatically retry the conversion or notify a technician for manual intervention.

4. **Detailed Logging & Notification**:
   - Enhanced logging for corruption detection, including timestamps and retry statuses, should be integrated. The admin notification system will alert the administrator of any ongoing corruption or recovery attempts.
