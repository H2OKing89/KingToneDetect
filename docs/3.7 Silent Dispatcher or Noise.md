# **3.7 Silent Dispatcher or Noise**

- **Problem**: The program may fail to stop recording if the dispatcher pauses too long, or background noise is detected as a tone. This can lead to runaway recordings or misinterpretation of noise as valid tones, resulting in incorrect or incomplete recordings.
  
- **Solution**: Adjust the **silence detection sensitivity** and implement **noise reduction** to differentiate between genuine dispatch tones and background noise. The program will dynamically adjust the silence threshold based on ambient noise levels and handle longer pauses from dispatchers effectively, avoiding premature recording stops. Additionally, a **noise reduction system** will filter out background sounds during both tone detection and recording to ensure accuracy.

silence_detection_grace_period = 5.0  ; Time before silence detection starts (seconds)
silence_duration_threshold = 10.0  ; Maximum silence before stopping recording (seconds)
convert_to_mp3 = true  ; Convert WAV to MP3 after recording

wav_file_path = /audio/wav/  ; Directory for WAV files
mp3_file_path = /audio/mp3/  ; Directory for MP3 files
audio_codec_path = /codec/  ; Directory for audio codec used during conversion
disk_space_limit_mb = 500  ; Optional: Stop recording if disk space falls below this threshold (in MB)
max_parallel_recordings = 5  ; Maximum number of parallel recordings allowed
recording_isolation = true  ; Enable isolation for parallel recordings
recording_priority = equal  ; Priority handling for simultaneous recordings
disk_space_error_threshold_mb = 100  ; Trigger an alert if available space drops below this
on_disk_space_error = stop_recording  ; Action to take when disk space is critically low

; ==================
; SILENCE DETECTION & NOISE CONFIGURATION
; ==================
[Silence_Detection]
enable_silence_detection = true  ; Enable silence detection to end recordings
adaptive_silence_threshold = true  ; Dynamically adjust silence detection based on ambient noise
silence_threshold_range = -60:-30  ; Allowable range for silence threshold (in dB)
long_pause_threshold = 15  ; Max allowable silence duration during dispatcher pauses (seconds)
silence_duration_threshold = 10.0  ; Max continuous silence duration before stopping the recording

[Noise_Reduction]
enable_noise_reduction = true  ; Enable noise reduction during tone detection and recording
noise_reduction_level = moderate  ; Noise reduction level: low, moderate, high
```

#### **Details**
- **Silence Detection**: 
  - Silence detection parameters allow the system to stop recording after a prolonged silence. 
  - **adaptive_silence_threshold** is used to adjust based on the ambient noise level.
  - **long_pause_threshold** handles dispatcher pauses, allowing for short breaks without ending the recording prematurely.

- **Noise Reduction**:
  - Filters background noise to ensure that only valid tones are detected. The **noise_reduction_level** allows for different degrees of noise filtering depending on the environment (e.g., low for quiet environments, high for noisy ones).
