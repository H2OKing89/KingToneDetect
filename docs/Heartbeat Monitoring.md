# Heartbeat Monitoring

- **Purpose**:  
  Heartbeat monitoring is a lightweight system to ensure that the **KingToneDetect** program is functioning as expected. This heartbeat mechanism periodically updates a local file to confirm the system is still operational. This feature is optional but useful for administrators who want continuous monitoring.

- **File Update Process**:  
  The heartbeat file is regularly updated at intervals defined in the configuration. The file typically contains a timestamp or simple log entry confirming the system's health. This can be monitored by third-party software or scripts to ensure the system hasn't stalled or crashed.

- **Monitoring Tools**:  
  Any third-party monitoring tool, custom script, or cron job can be used to check for regular updates to the heartbeat file. If the file is not updated within the expected timeframe, it could indicate a failure in the system, allowing for quick remediation.

- **Configurable Parameters**:
  - Users can configure heartbeat parameters within the global `config.ini` file to customize the monitoring behavior according to their environment.

#### **Example Configuration for Heartbeat Monitoring (config.ini):**

```ini
; Heartbeat Configuration
[Heartbeat]
heartbeat_enable = true  ; Enable/disable the heartbeat functionality
heartbeat_file_path = /logs/heartbeat/heartbeat.txt  ; Path to the heartbeat file
heartbeat_update_interval = 60.0  ; Time interval (in seconds) to update the heartbeat file
```

- **Explanation of Parameters**:
  - `heartbeat_enable`: Set to `true` to enable heartbeat monitoring. If set to `false`, the feature will be disabled.
  - `heartbeat_file_path`: Specifies the location of the file where the heartbeat updates will be written. Itâ€™s recommended to store this file in a directory where it can be easily monitored.
  - `heartbeat_update_interval`: The interval, in seconds, at which the heartbeat file will be updated. This ensures regular health checks for the system.
